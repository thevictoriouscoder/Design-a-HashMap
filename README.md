Initial version of hashMap with chaining:

Notice a lot of collisions after inserting hashes of the keys, this can significantly increase the time when searching for an element in a specific key, can optimize with linear probing to reduce collisions

By implementing linear probing approach, the number of collisions drastically decreases
